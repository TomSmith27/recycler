        <p>No More Bin Days was created to address the lack of information on where to recycle products that aren't accepted in our household bins. The mindset behind creating No More Bin Days is to encourage any action that can help our environment and our future - reducing consumption, reducing waste, recycling, supporting the local community, and more!</p>
        <p>We're working to add more features, get more data and make No More Bin Days even more useful for you. Please feel free to use the Contact Us form to add suggestions of things you would like to see added in the future.</p>
        <p>Thanks for your support.</p>
