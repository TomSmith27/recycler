      <p>Terracycle is a recycling scheme that recycles hard-to-recycle products. Terracycle have teamed up with various companies to create and run these recycling schemes. Many of the Terracycle recycling locations have been added to NoMoreBinDays. Many of the products listed in The Recycle Guide would not be able to be recycled without Terracycle - the crisp packets, sweetie wrappers, dental products and more are all recycled through Terracycle schemes.</p>
      <p>You can also get involved yourself and set-up a drop off location!</p>
